## Summary
This is the capstone project for Coursera's Linear Regression and Modeling MOOC. We are provided with a dataset of 651 movies from IMDB and asked to explore the data and build a linear regression model to predict movie ratings. It turns out that it was infeasible to build a high-performing linear regression model with this dataset, so identifying the statistically-significant predictors of movie ratings was promoted to primary goal.

### Goals
•Primary: To determine which variable(s) can be used to predict IMDB movie ratings (looking at p-values). <br />
•Secondary: To build a linear regression model that predicts IMDB movie ratings (looking at adjusted R-squared).

### Exploratory Data Analysis
After some data cleaning
