## Summary
This is the capstone project for Coursera's Linear Regression and Modeling MOOC. We are provided with a dataset of 651 movies from IMDB and asked to explore the data and build a linear regression model to predict movie ratings. It turns out that it was infeasible to build a high-performing linear regression model with this dataset, so identify the statistically-significant predictors of movie ratings was promoted to being the primary goal.

### Primary Goal
To determine which variable(s) can be used to predict IMDB movie ratings (looking at p-values).

### Secondary Goal
To build a linear regression model that predicts IMDB movie ratings (looking at adjusted R-squared).

### Univariate Analysis
After some data cleaning
